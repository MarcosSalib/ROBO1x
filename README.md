# Robotics Specialization - University of Pennsylvania

The following are 6 courses offered by University of Pennsylvania on Coursera. They represent concepts of robot flight and movement, how robots perceive their environment, and how they adjust their movements to avoid obstacles, navigate difficult terrains and accomplish complex tasks such as construction and disaster recovery.
The specialization includes real world examples of how robots have been applied in disaster situations, how they have made advances in human health care and what their future capabilities will be. The courses build towards a capstone in which a robot is programmed to perform a variety of movements such as flying and grasping objects.
